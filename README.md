## DSA Reminder App

The **DSA Reminder App** helps users stay consistent with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice by providing automated reminders at strategic intervals. 

**Problem Statement:**  
Maintaining a regular DSA practice schedule is challenging, and many learners forget to revisit important problems, resulting in inconsistent preparation and weaker retention.

**Solution:**  
The app tracks users’ DSA problem-solving activities and automatically sends reminders after 3, 7, and 15 days for each problem—ensuring spaced repetition. This approach helps reinforce learning and supports a structured, effective study routine.
